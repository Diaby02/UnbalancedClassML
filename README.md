# UnbalancedClassML
This repo contains the code of the final work of the course  [Machine Learning: classification and evaluation] (https://uclouvain.be/cours-2024-linfo2262)

The goal of this project is to predict the performance of our model on an unseen dataset. How close we are from our prediction, and how close it is high,
how better is it. For this purpose, we only receive a training dataset. We thus have to make our own train-val-test splitting in order to guess our prediction.
The main difficulty is the fact the it is an multiclass unbalanced dataset.

The result of the course are attributed following your position on a ranking along the students following the class (approx 200 students)

I managed to get the second place, with a prediction of 87%, and a true prediction of 89.2 (2.2 diff)
